## What is app? 

<p align="justify">
This a app was developed in Omni Stack Week by Diego Fernandes (Rocketseat). The goal is develop a app that can find developers based in technologies they are using next to your localization. In desktop version, just is possible to register the users. In mobile version, have will a map with the developers found from your technologies.

I got better the **frontend** part of application, let the desktop version more or less like that:
